# Rock Paper Scissors Classifier

This project implements a real-time Rock-Paper-Scissors hand gesture classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and OpenCV. The system can recognize your hand gestures via webcam and classify them as rock, paper, or scissors.

## Features

- **CNN-based model** trained on images of rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures.
- **Real-time webcam input** to classify hand gestures live.
- Image preprocessing with normalization and resizing.
- Simple and lightweight architecture, suitable for learning and experimenting.
- Model saving and loading functionality to reuse trained weights.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow (for building and training the CNN model)
- OpenCV (for webcam video capture and image preprocessing)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
